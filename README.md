Hi! 
I am non-traditional single mother of two. I am from both New York and Wyoming. I have a big family in both locations. My father is from NY and my mother is from Wyoming. My children are happy and thats what matters most to me. My oldest daughter just received her AS in Health Science and will be coming to UW in the fall. She says she won't live with me but I know that doesn't apply to eating dinner with my son and I :D  Life is good, Creator woke me up today. Stay up, stay blessed and stay positive. What you concentrate on in your life multiplies. If you focus on your blessings or obstacles. Let the flowers remind us why the rain is so necessary.
